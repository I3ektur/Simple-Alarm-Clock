# Simple-Alarm-Clock
This is a simple alarm clock program written in Python. Basically, you set a specific time for the alarm, and when your computer's clock hits that time, the program plays an audio file to wake you up. It's a straightforward way to make sure you donâ€™t oversleep or forget something important.
